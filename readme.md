# Standard Moves

1. Get white cross
2. Get corner
3. Get edge in 2nd layer.

## Get Yellow Plus

Algo: F U R U' R' F'
```
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  |   | A |   |         |   | C'|   |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  | x | x | B |   --->  | x | x | A |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  |   | C |   |         |   | B'|   |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
```

Algo: F R U R' U' F'
```
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  |   | B |   |         |   | A |   |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  | x | x | A |   --->  | x | x | C'|
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  |   | C |   |         |   | B'|   |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
```

Thus, If you have:
```
  +---+---+---+
  |   | x |   | Use FUR-URF
  +---+---+---+
  | x | x |   |
  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+

  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   | Use FRU-URF
  +---+---+---+
  | x | x | x |
  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+

  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   | Use any of one, and the other one.
  +---+---+---+
  |   | x |   |
  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+

No other possibility exists.
```

## Get yellow face

Algo: R U R' U R U U R'
```
    b       b                 r       f
  +---+---+---+             +---+---+---+
l | P | a | Q | r         R | f | b | S | l  * Edges undergo anti-clock shift except edge-c
  +---+---+---+             +---+---+---+    * Corners S&Q, P&R are swapped.
  | d | x | b |    -->      | a | x | d |    * S goes undisturbed w.r.t yellow face
  +---+---+---+             +---+---+---+    * Note the R-f, Q-r, P-b come on top.
l | S | c | R | r         b | r | c | b | P
  +---+---+---+             +---+---+---+
    f       f                 Q       l
```

So, if you have

|  No  |  No Yellow Already  |  Name           |   Orient        |   Next step  |
| ---- | ------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------|
|  1   |  1                  |  Regular fish   |    Std          |         (1)  |
|  2   |  1                  |  Other fish     |    Std          | RgrFsh  (2)  |
|  3   |  0                  |  Double Headlgt | Yellow on side  | RgrFsh  (2)  |
|  4   |  0                  |  Chameleon car  | Yellow on side  | RgrFsh  (2)  |
|  5   |  2                  |  HeadLight      | Hdl in front    | OtrFsh  (3)  |
|  6   |  2                  |  Chameleon      | Yellow in LFT   | OtrFsh  (3)  |
|  7   |  2                  |  Diagnol        | Yellow in LFT   | OthFsh  (3)  |

Basically, its always LFT corner of interest.
* If 1 yellow, then yellow faces up
* If 0 yellow, then yellow is on left side
* If 2 yellow, then yellow is facing you

## Get Yellow Corners right

* Align existing 2 matched corners. And F is the opp side.
* Otherwise, 2 diagnol corners will be matching. Then do it 2 times

### Algo
R' F R' B B R F' R' B B R R U'
### Menomic
* Radio-frequency, R' to begin with.
* R' B B R (the R' matches first R)
* F'       (this is opp to the R'-F you begin with)
* R' B B R
* R U' (this you will easily realize as you do)

## Get Yellow Edges right

### Algo
F F U L R' F F L' R U F F
### Mnemonic
* F-full, rolling on the floor laughing, ruff
* Basically, 2 F's and the U is in the direction of adjustment.
* L/R towards you first. and Against you next.
* The last U is easily visible.

# The other standard move.

* Same as regular until yellow cross (FRU-RUF)
* Now instead of targeting yellow-face, make sure the yellow edges are rightly in place with their color
    * you either have it all aligned or 2 adjacents ones are okay and other two aren't. No other possibility.
    * Keep the 2 aligned on R and B sides and do R-U-R'-U-R-U2-R'
    * This will align all yellow edges
* Now make sure all yellow corners are in place (but oriented anyway)
    * you either have it all aligned Or (one in place, and other 3 unaligned). No other possibility
    * You will have to do U R U' L' U R' U' L.
    * It will switch the 3. You have to do it one or two times
        ```
          +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
          | A | . | B |         | B | . | C |
          +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
          | . | . | . |   --->  | . | . | . |
          +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
          | C | . | G |         | A | . | G |
          +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
        ```
* Now Orient the yellow corners Correctly with yellow coming to top.
    * Algo: R U R' U R U2 R' L' U' L U' L' U2 L.
    * Note that the 2nd half is a mirror image of first half, which is the std step.
        ```
            B                     C
          +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
        C | A | . | . |       A | B | . | . |
          +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
          | . | . | . |   --->  | . | . | . |
          +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
        Q | P | . | . |       P | R | . | . |
          +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
            R                     Q
        ```
    * It will orient the left 2 corners. If your yellows are on F&B, you are done in one step.
    * Otherwise you will have to do this utmost 3 times.

### other cases

* Case of having both corner and edge on top layer.
    * The corner's top color matches the edge's top color
        * If they are touching-touching the right way, its the easy case.
        * If they are not touching-touching, put the corner down, and orient the
                edge to arrive at its touching-touching position.
            * You will have to move the white to corner of other side(side not on top),
                and make the edge piece go to the non-involed side.
        * If they are touching-touching the wrong way:
            * Make the corner come to the top color's side. The edge is hence on the
                non-involved side.
            * Put corner down. Move edge 180. (You can also do just 90. But this maintains
                symm-with the white-on-top-case)
            * Bring corner back up. Now move corner 180 to other side. Put it down.
            * Bring edge to its desired position for touching-touching.
    * Corner's top is opposite to Edge's.
        * You target simple roll-over.
        * Put corner-down. Aligh edge to its right spot.
    * White on top
        * Align edge with its side.
            * Corner not-touching or corner touching and is in target-location.
                * Rotate edge away.
                * For corner-not-touching, bring corner on top of edge.
                    * you will have touch-touching case now.
                * For corner-touching/at-target-loc case, move corner 180.
                    * you will have simple rollover case.
            * Corner touching and is at the away side.
                * You can't rotate edge away, as that puts corner down.
                * Bring corner 180* to other side. Edge will goto non-involed side.
                * Put corner down. Move edge 180. Bring corner up
                * You are now in the non-touching case. Rotate edge away
                * Bring white 180* on top of edge. Restore.
                * You are in touching-touching case.
* If edge is on top and corner is in bottom layer.
    * Try to shoot for easy-case as you move up.
        * If white is down. target simple rollover.
        * If white on side, touching or simple rollover. (depends on edge color on top)
        * sometimes touching is not possible, in that case, shoot for white-on-top
* If edge is in middle, again try to get into one of the easy cases.

### Mnemonics

* Regular Fish : regular!
* Other   Fish : R direction start with towards you, instead of against you, and its U' instead of U
* Chameleon/Diagnol: Diagnol starts with D. Its RUR' - D - RU'R' - D'
* Double Hdl:
    * Total of 6 Rs
    * It goes same as regular until R-U-R'-U-R
    * Then instead of UU-R' as in regular, you have U'-R' (this finishes until regular), and one extra round R-U2-R'
  ```
    R  U
    R' U
    R  U'
    R' U
    R  U2
    R'
  ```
* Hdl:
    * 5 R-activities.
    * First is R2 and R' starts from 2nd. Also note R' at end
    * D is first. This is the only one to have D among last 3. And, there is no single U/U', when D is there.
    * D/U2 alternate
  ```
    R2 D
    R'   U2
    R  D'
    R'   U2
    R'
  ```
* Chameleon Car:
    * 5 R-activites. U' all the way. U'2 first and last U's in between.
    * There is no R' and U at all.
    * Remember symmetry - 3 R2 sandwiched between R. 2 U' sandwiched between U2.
        * The U2 is outer, and R2 is inner.
