## Get Yellow Plus

Algo: F U R U' R' F'
```
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  |   | A |   |         |   | C'|   |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  | x | x | B |   --->  | x | x | A |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  |   | C |   |         |   | B'|   |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
```

Algo: F R U R' U' F'
```
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  |   | B |   |         |   | A |   |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  | x | x | A |   --->  | x | x | C'|
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
  |   | C |   |         |   | B'|   |
  +---+---+---+         +---+---+---+
```

Thus, If you have:
```
  +---+---+---+
  |   | x |   | Use FUR-URF
  +---+---+---+
  | x | x |   |
  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+

  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   | Use FRU-URF
  +---+---+---+
  | x | x | x |
  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+

  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   | Use any of one, and the other one.
  +---+---+---+
  |   | x |   |
  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+

No other possibility exists.
```

## Get yellow face

Algo: R U R' U R U U R'
```
    b       b                 r       f
  +---+---+---+             +---+---+---+
l | P | a | Q | r         R | f | b | S | l  * Edges undergo anti-clock shift except edge-c
  +---+---+---+             +---+---+---+    * Corners S&Q, P&R are swapped.
  | d | x | b |    -->      | a | x | d |    * S goes undisturbed w.r.t yellow face
  +---+---+---+             +---+---+---+    * Note the R-f, Q-r, P-b come on top.
l | S | c | R | r         b | r | c | b | P
  +---+---+---+             +---+---+---+
    f       f                 Q       l
```

So, if you have

|  No  |  No Yellow Already  |  Name           |   Orient        |   Next step  |
| ---- | ------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------|
|  1   |  1                  |  Regular fish   |    Std          |         (1)  |
|  2   |  1                  |  Other fish     |    Std          | RgrFsh  (2)  |
|  3   |  0                  |  Double Headlgt | Yellow on side  | RgrFsh  (2)  |
|  4   |  0                  |  Chameleon car  | Yellow on side  | RgrFsh  (2)  |
|  5   |  2                  |  HeadLight      | Hdl in front    | OtrFsh  (3)  |
|  6   |  2                  |  Chameleon      | Yellow in LFT   | OtrFsh  (3)  |
|  7   |  2                  |  Diagnol        | Yellow in LFT   | OthFsh  (3)  |

Basically, its always LFT corner of interest.
* If 1 yellow, then yellow faces up
* If 0 yellow, then yellow is on left side
* If 2 yellow, then yellow is facing you

## Get Yellow Corners right

* Align existing 2 matched corners. And F is the opp side.
* Otherwise, 2 diagnol corners will be matching. Then do it 2 times

### Algo
R' F R' B B R F' R' B B R R U'
### Menomic
* Radio-frequency, R' to begin with.
* R' B B R (the R' matches first R)
* F'       (this is opp to the R'-F you begin with)
* R' B B R
* R U' (this you will easily realize as you do)

## Get Yellow Edges right

### Algo
F F U L R' F F L' R U F F
### Mnemonic
* F-full, rolling on the floor laughing, ruff
* Basically, 2 F's and the U is in the direction of adjustment.
* L/R towards you first. and Against you next.
* The last U is easily visible.

### Mnemonics

* Regular Fish : regular!
* Other   Fish : R direction start with towards you, instead of against you, and its U' instead of U
* Chameleon/Diagnol: Diagnol starts with D. Its RUR' - D - RU'R' - D'
* Double Hdl: Total of 6 Rs, start with R(away, like regular-fish). U is in between every R. First 2 U's are regular, 3rd is U', last is U2(this is visible)
  ```
    R  U
    R' U
    R  U'
    R' U
    R  U2
    R'
  ```
* Hdl: 5 R-activities. First is R2, then R'-R 2 times. First and third its D/D'. 2nd/4th its U2
  ```
    R2 D
    R'   U2
    R  D'
    R'   U2
    R'
  ```
* Chameleon Car: 5 R-activites. U' all the way. U'2 first and last U's in between.
