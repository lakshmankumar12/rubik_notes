Note:
* When both are in place, white is on side as you start
* When only one is in place, white is on F, when you start

Different types:

* Edge is in place.
    * White oriented way-1
    * White oriented way-2 (The page shows only one way)

# Both pieces are in place. Only to flip them.

## edge in place. White corner-piece to correct.

Yellow on top. One face is F, other is R. Here white should be on R-side.
    * Algo: F2 U2 F U F' U F U2 F
    * Note that this is F2,U2,and then R-U-R'-U-R-U2-R', but done on F, and the last is R and not R'
    * So, do a F2 U2. This will get the corner-to-adjust + a good-middle + a good-corner(or yet to focus corner) on top.
        * Now keep the good-edge at L-side/good-corner at LF and start the R-U-... algo.

If white is on F-side, simply, keep this corner of interest as your F and L-side.
    * So, do a F2 U2.
    * Now keep the good-edge at R-side/good-corner at RF and start L-U'... algo


## white corner-piece in place. Only edge to correct.

Keep the edge-to-fix at F-R. White bott/Yellow-top as usual.
    * Algo: F2 U2 R' F2 R U2 F U' F
    * how it works:
        * Here is a pic of the F-face (XX-dontcare, DD-dontdisturb, FL-flip, CC - center anyway)
                XX  XX  XX
                DD  CC  FL
                DD  DD  DD
        * It is an operation on F,R,U only. If you see, there is a symmetry for all the 4 DD-pieces.
          Only the FL gets flipped. The DC's ofcouse get jumbled up.
        * You have to memorize the order.
            * Remember - F2 U2 R' - F2 R U2   (fur-fru, with r-towards first and f2,u2)
            * After that its straightfoward anyway. It will be touching-touching good case - so F' U F.

## flip both white and edge piece.

Edge to fix is at F-R. White on corner is on right side.
    * Algo: F' U F' U' L' U L F2
    * how it works:
        * Here is a pic of the F-face and U-face. (DD is also WW - the not-to-disturb ones)

        * You can observe the flipping happening with practice.

If W is facing you, then simply keep the corner/edge to fix on the L-side and mirror the algo
    * Algo: F U' F U R U' R' F2

Not sure if WW on right, and facing side has FF instead of RR of corner-piece, is a possibility.

# Edge in place. Corner piece to be brought down

## edge rightly aligned

### White faces side

* white is one side, other side is aligned.
    * Algo:        [U] F' U F U2 F' U F
    * Move the white, so that its on the f-face on top.
    * Put white down, slide edge one step further
    * Bring white up, you have the same-color touching-touching case.

* Not clear if its a possibility at all to have white on side and the other side not of the same color.

### White faces top

* White on top, edge is already aligned.
    * When white kept on top, the colors aren't aligned.
    * Algo: [U2] F' U  L' U' L  U' F
        * Inverse: F' U La U Lt U' F U2
    * How it works?
        * Just keep doing it and see the flow!

              Start         [U2]           F'          U           L'(away)      U'        L(towards)      U'          F voila!
        * The idea is to put the corner below to the edge intead of above it as its at the start.
        * For this, we bring the edge on to the B-face from F-face via (F'-U-Laway).
        * Now we bring the corner atop it - so that its now behind edge. (U')
        * Restore (Ltowards-U'-F)





    * I guess if whte is on top and colors are aligned, you are good to go for touching-touching case.

## Edge not alighned.

### white faces side
* White on top, edge is not aligned.
    * Algo:      [U] F' U' F U' R U R'
        * Inverse:  R U' R' U F' U F
    * Move the white, so that its on the f-face on top.
    * Put white down, slide edge one step away
    * Bring white up, you have the simple rollover case.

* Not clear if its a possibility at all to have white on side and the other side is aligned.

### White faces top

* Algo:      F' U F R U2 R'
    * Inverse: R U2 R' F' U' F
* This is just touching-touching.
* Flip it to get out of way (F' U). Restore front face (F)
* Just do R-U2-R' (Tip:Dont waste time by doing U-R-U-R')

* Not clear if its a possibility at all to have white on side and its touching-touching bad.

# Corner in place. Edge to be brought down.

## Corner correctly placed.

* This is actually the slow-algorithm. (Where you finish white-corners first)

* Algo:  [U] R U' R' U' F' U F
    * Inverse:  F' U' F U R U R'

* Move the middle piece on the other side to where it should come. [remember :) ]
* Bring white on top with the R-operation (or L)
* The middle piece comes to F-face (also pushing the corner and de-orienting it)
* Revert the R(or-L) operation. This now makes it touching-touching
* Move it back in same dir as how you made the middle piece coe to F. So the touching-touching is on R(or-L) now.
* F-U'-F to place it back. This should be obvious

## corner incorrect

### when edge is aligned to its color, white is on side.

Note flip, and keep white as your F face.

                                                   (at this point
                                                   F face is good,
                                                   but R face is
                                                   wrong)
    * R-U' gets its touching-touching.
    * R2   brings it aligned on F-face
    * F-R-F' restores the R-face.


### when edge is aligned to its color, white is on F

Keep white on F-side

O.Algo: R' D' R D R' D' R
Algo:   F' U' F U F' U' F
    Inverse: F' U F U' F' U F

* F'-U'-F makes it rollover-ready.
* U onto position
* F'-U'-F rollever.
